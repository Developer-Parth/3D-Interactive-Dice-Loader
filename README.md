## ⚙️ How Does It Work? (Brain Behind the Dice)
### 🔹 **1. 3D Dice Animation**
- Uses **CSS transforms** like `rotateX()` and `rotateY()` to spin the dice in a **random direction**.
- `setInterval()` ensures the dice moves **every second** with new random angles.
- CSS transitions make everything **smooth as butter**! 🧈

### 🔹 **2. Theme Switching**
- A **toggle button** lets you **switch between Dark, Light, and Custom themes**.
- JavaScript `body.classList.toggle()` dynamically applies the new theme.
- One click = instant **vibe switch**! 🔄✨

### 🔹 **3. Auto-Roll Effect**
- The dice rolls **automatically every few seconds**.
- Uses **Math.random()** to generate a **new angle each time**.
- `rotateX()` and `rotateY()` apply these random angles to create a realistic rolling effect.

## 🖥️ Technologies Used (What Powers This Beast?)
- **HTML5** 🏗️ – The skeleton.
- **CSS3** 🎨 – The glow-up.
- **Vanilla JavaScript** ⚡ – The real magic.
